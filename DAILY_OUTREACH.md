### Facebook Group Post (paste into: "Personal Trainers Australia" group)

```
Honest question for the PTs in here — how much are you actually paying for client management software right now?

I ask because I got tired of paying TrueCoach ~$140 AUD/mo for software running on US servers that lags every morning during peak hours. So I built an alternative specifically for Australian PTs.

FitMunch — what it does:
✅ Client workout + nutrition planning in one place
✅ Progress tracking + check-ins
✅ PT dashboard to manage your whole roster
✅ $59 AUD/mo Starter (unlimited clients) vs TrueCoach's $140+ AUD
✅ AU-focused (AUD pricing, GST-ready, no US server lag)
✅ 14-day free trial, no credit card

Genuinely looking for 10 PTs to use it and give honest feedback — happy to jump on a call and set it up for you personally.
