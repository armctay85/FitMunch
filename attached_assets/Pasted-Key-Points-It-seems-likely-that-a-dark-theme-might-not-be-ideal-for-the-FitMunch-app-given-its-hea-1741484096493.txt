Key Points
It seems likely that a dark theme might not be ideal for the FitMunch app, given its health and fitness focus, though many apps like crypto.com use dark themes effectively.
Research suggests dark themes can reduce eye strain in low light but may affect readability and brand alignment for fitness apps.
The evidence leans toward offering both light and dark themes to cater to user preferences, enhancing accessibility and user satisfaction.
Why a Dark Theme Might Not Be Good
Dark themes, with their black or dark gray backgrounds and light text, have become popular in apps like crypto.com for their sleek, modern look and benefits like reduced eye strain in low-light conditions and battery savings on OLED screens. However, there are reasons why a dark theme might not be suitable for the FitMunch app, especially given its health and fitness focus:
Readability Concerns: Light text on dark backgrounds can be harder to read for some users, particularly those with visual impairments or age-related vision changes, potentially impacting accessibility.
Mood and Context: Dark colors might not convey the energy and positivity expected from a fitness app, which aims to motivate users for activities like meal planning and workouts.
Brand Identity: If FitMunch’s brand is associated with bright, vibrant colors, a dark theme could dilute this identity, confusing users.
User Preference: While some users prefer dark themes, others may find them less appealing, and offering only a dark theme could alienate those who prefer light themes for better visibility.
Design Challenges: Ensuring a dark theme is both aesthetically pleasing and functional requires careful contrast management, which can be complex and costly to implement.
Despite these concerns, offering both light and dark themes could be a balanced approach, catering to diverse user needs and enhancing overall satisfaction. Many successful health and fitness apps provide this option, recognizing varying preferences.

Why a Dark Theme Might Not Be Good for FitMunch
For FitMunch, a health and fitness app, a dark theme might not be ideal for several reasons:
Readability Issues: As noted in Dark UIs. The Good and the Bad. Dos and Don’ts. | Toptal®, dark themes can be dramatic and stylish but come with challenges, including readability for users with visual impairments. Light text on dark backgrounds can be less accessible, potentially impacting user engagement.

Dark themes, associated with calmness or even negativity, might not align with these goals, as suggested by Pros and Cons of Dark Theme Websites | Igniting Business, which notes dark themes can affect user perception.
Brand Identity Mismatch: If FitMunch’s brand is traditionally associated with light, fresh colors, a dark theme could confuse users and dilute brand consistency, a point raised in Dark Mode in Web Apps: A11Y Pros and Cons | DubBot, highlighting the need for alignment with user expectations.

Comparison with crypto.com
Crypto.com’s dark theme works well for its context, as finance apps often cater to users in low-light environments, and the dark aesthetic aligns with its tech-savvy, modern brand. However, FitMunch’s context differs: users are likely to use it during the day for planning and tracking, where a light theme might be more refreshing and motivating. The unexpected detail here is that while dark themes are popular, their effectiveness varies by sector, and health apps might benefit more from light themes for user engagement.
Implementation Considerations
An unexpected detail is the potential for offering both light and dark modes, which could address user preferences without committing to one. This approach, supported by Why Your App Should Have Both Dark And Light Themes | Eevis Panula, Software Developer, ensures accessibility and caters to diverse needs, enhancing commercial success. For FitMunch, this could mean a default light theme with a toggle for dark mode, aligning with modern app design trends.
Conclusion
While dark themes offer benefits like reduced eye strain and a modern look, they may not be ideal for FitMunch due to readability concerns, mood association, and brand alignment. Offering both light and dark themes could be a balanced solution, ensuring user satisfaction and accessibility. This approach addresses the user’s observation of apps like crypto.com while tailoring recommendations to FitMunch’s health and fitness focus.
