Below is a freelance brief tailored for hiring a developer to take the FitMunch app (assuming it’s hosted on Replit or similar) and prepare it for testing and approval on the Google Play Store. This brief incorporates the feedback from the prior review and focuses on Android-specific requirements.
Freelance Brief: FitMunch App - Android Testing and Google Play Approval
Project Overview
Project Name: FitMunch Android Optimization and Google Play Submission
App Name: FitMunch
Version: 1.0.0
Type: Health & Fitness
Platform Focus: Android (Google Play Store)
Current State: Hosted on Replit (or similar environment), partially functional with critical issues to resolve.
Objective: Prepare the FitMunch app for testing, resolve critical issues, and ensure it meets Google Play Store requirements for a successful launch.
Project Scope
We need an experienced Android developer to:
Take the existing FitMunch app codebase (currently on Replit or similar).
Fix critical functionality issues (e.g., In-App Purchases, user accounts).
Optimize performance and ensure compliance with Google Play policies.
Conduct thorough testing.
Prepare and submit the app for Google Play Store approval.
Deliverables
Fully Functional Android App:
All core features operational (Meal Planning, Workout Tracking, Recipe Database, Progress Tracking, Shopping List).
Critical issues resolved (see below).
Google Play Store Submission:
App meets all Google Play technical and policy requirements.
All required assets uploaded (icons, feature graphic, screenshots).
Content rating survey completed.
Testing Report:
Documentation of testing process and results (e.g., bug fixes, performance benchmarks).
Source Code:
Updated, clean, and well-commented codebase delivered back to us.
Critical Issues to Resolve
Based on a prior review, the following must be addressed:
In-App Purchases (IAP) Not Working:
Implement and test Google Play Billing for subscription plans: Free ($0), Basic ($5.99), Premium ($12.99), Pro Coach ($29.99).
Ensure receipt validation is in place to verify purchases.
User Accounts Not Implemented:
Add user account functionality (e.g., email login, Google Sign-In).
Enable cross-device syncing via cloud storage (e.g., Firebase).
SubscriptionManager Initialization Issues:
Fix initialization errors to ensure subscription handling works reliably.
Technical Requirements
Platform: Android (APK compatible with Android 8.0+).
Compatibility:  
Google Fit integration fully functional.  
Push notifications working.  
Deep linking implemented.
Performance: Optimize for minimal battery and memory usage.
Analytics: Fix syntax error in Analytics.js (line 342) or integrate a working analytics solution (e.g., Firebase Analytics).
Google Play Store Readiness
Assets:  
App icons (512x512px and adaptive icons).  
Feature graphic (1024x500px).  
Screenshots (minimum 2, optimized for various screen sizes).
Content Rating: Complete Google Play’s content rating survey.  
Policy Compliance:  
Ensure privacy policy is included and linked (covering HealthKit/Google Fit data usage).  
Meet Google Play’s monetization and IAP guidelines.
Testing Requirements
Functional Testing: Verify all features work as intended (e.g., meal planning, workout tracking).  
Device Testing: Test on multiple Android devices/emulators (e.g., Samsung, Pixel) across versions (Android 8.0–14).  
Performance Testing: Benchmark load times, battery usage, and memory consumption.  
Bug Fixes: Resolve any crashes or errors identified during testing.
Timeline
Total Duration: 3–4 weeks (adjustable based on complexity).  
Milestones:  
Week 1: Fix critical issues (IAP, user accounts, SubscriptionManager).  
Week 2: Optimize performance and integrate Google Play requirements.  
Week 3: Testing and bug fixing.  
Week 4: Finalize assets, submit to Google Play, and deliver code/report.
Budget
Range: $1,500–$2,500 (negotiable based on experience and timeline).  
Payment Terms:  
30% upfront.  
30% after critical issues are fixed (Milestone 1).  
40% upon successful Google Play submission and delivery.
Freelancer Requirements
Experience:  
Proven track record with Android app development and Google Play submissions (portfolio or examples required).  
Familiarity with Replit (or similar) environments and migrating codebases.
Skills:  
Kotlin or Java (depending on FitMunch’s codebase).  
Google Play Billing Library.  
Firebase (for syncing/analytics).  
Debugging and performance optimization.
Communication:  
Regular updates (e.g., weekly progress reports).  
Available via email/Slack for quick queries.
How to Apply
Submit a proposal including:  
Relevant experience with Android apps and Google Play launches.
