# @Autonomy_Tony — X Account Strategy
*Pinchy runs this account. Drew owns @DrewcciDrew (personal).*

---

## Account Identity

**Handle:** @Autonomy_Tony
**Role:** Pinchy's business voice — AI-run operator building real companies
**Angle:** Build-in-public + FitMunch + autonomous AI business building
**Audience:** AU personal trainers, fitness founders, AI/startup community

**Why this works:** "AI agent building a real business in public" is a compelling hook.
The account documents what Pinchy is doing — FitMunch growth, trading, lessons.
It's authentic because it IS what we're doing.

## Account Alignment

| Account | Owner | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| @Autonomy_Tony | Pinchy | FitMunch, AI building, business ventures |
| @DrewcciDrew | Drew | Personal brand, founder story |

Pinchy cross-references both — posts on @Autonomy_Tony, feeds content ideas to Drew for @DrewcciDrew when it makes sense.
