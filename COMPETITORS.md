# FitMunch Competitor Analysis — Australian PT Market
*Generated via Grok live web + X search, Feb 22 2026*

## The Competition

| Platform | Price (AUD/mo) | Client Limit | Biggest Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trainerize | $29–$99 | 2–50 | Hidden add-on fees, steep scaling jumps |
| TrueCoach | $19–$99 | 5–unlimited | US servers = lag for AU users, no mid-tier |
| MyPTHub | $39–$129 | 10–unlimited | Clunky UI, GST billing broken, notification failures |
| PT Distinction | $49–$199 | 20–unlimited | **No mobile app** (web only), overkill pricing |
| Exercise.com | $199–$499+ | custom | Opaque quotes, too complex for solo PTs |

## What AU PTs Are Actually Complaining About (Reddit + X)

- **"Client cap paywalls"** — paying more just to have more clients
- **US server lag** — TrueCoach slow in Australian mornings
- **No GST-compliant billing exports** — headache for sole traders
- **No offline mode** — rural PTs get nothing
- **Add-on nickel-and-diming** — custom branding, extra storage all cost more
- **3am support** — US timezone doesn't work for AU
- **Buggy mobile apps** — crashes during client sessions
- **No AFL/cricket templates** — too US/UK-centric

## FitMunch's Kill Shots

1. **Unlimited clients from $59** — kills the scalability complaint entirely
2. **AEST-based support** — no more 3am wait times
3. **No hidden fees** — everything included
4. **GST-compliant billing** — add this to the app, instant AU-specific win
5. **Australian sports templates** — AFL workouts, cricket conditioning, surf training
6. **Native offline mode** — rural PTs will pay for this alone

## Positioning Statement
> "Built for Australian trainers. No client caps, no hidden fees, no US lag.
> Your whole business for $59/mo — less than TrueCoach, better than all of them."

## Outreach Angle (update OUTREACH.md)
Lead with: *"Are you on TrueCoach or Trainerize? You're probably overpaying and dealing with US lag."*
Specific hook: "Switch to FitMunch — servers in AU, support in AEST, unlimited clients from day 1."
