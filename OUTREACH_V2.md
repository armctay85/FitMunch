# FitMunch Outreach V2 — AU Personal Trainers
*Backed by Grok live X research + competitor intel — Feb 22 2026*

## The Hook (use in every format)
> "TrueCoach and Trainerize are US products with US servers. Australian PTs cop the lag every morning. FitMunch is built for Aus — no lag, no client caps, no hidden fees."

### Post 1 — Pain-led
```
Honest question for the PTs in here — how much are you actually paying for your client management software?

I was using TrueCoach at $99/mo and constantly dealing with:
- Slow loading times in Australian hours (US servers)
- Client cap paywalls every time I wanted to grow
- No GST-compliant invoice exports

Built a new platform specifically for AU trainers. Unlimited clients from $59/mo, AEST support, and GST sorted out of the box.

14-day free trial if anyone wants to test it: fitmunch.com.au

Not trying to sell you — genuinely curious if others have had the same experience.
```

### Post 2 — Value-led
```
For any PTs still using spreadsheets or cobbling together apps to manage clients — there's now an AU-built option worth looking at.

FitMunch: PT client management platform
✅ Unlimited clients ($59/mo Starter, $99/mo Pro)
✅ Workout + nutrition planning
✅ Client progress tracking + check-ins
✅ Australian pricing in AUD, GST-ready
✅ Servers in AU (no lag)
✅ 14-day free trial

Compared to TrueCoach (~$140 AUD/mo) and PT Distinction (no mobile app at all) — we're cheaper and actually built for how Aussie PTs work.

### Post 3 — Curiosity/Poll
```
Quick poll for PTs: What's your biggest frustration with your current client management software?

A) Too expensive / client cap paywalls
B) US-based = lag during my working hours
C) No proper GST/invoicing for AU
D) The mobile app is garbage
E) I just use WhatsApp and spreadsheets tbh

Asking because we're building something specifically for AU PTs and want to make sure we're solving the right problems. Happy to share what we've built if anyone's interested 🙋

## LinkedIn Posts

### LinkedIn 1 — Industry insight
```
I've been looking at why Australian personal trainers are underserved by their software tools.

Here's what I found:

🇺🇸 TrueCoach, Trainerize, PT Distinction — all US-built, US-hosted.
→ Australian trainers deal with lag during peak morning hours
→ Pricing in USD means currency fluctuation headaches
→ No GST-compliant billing exports

🇦🇺 The opportunity: 70% of Australian PTs are independent sole traders. They need simple, affordable, AU-native tools — not enterprise software built for US gym chains.

That's what FitMunch is: PT client management built for Australian trainers.
• Unlimited clients from $59 AUD/mo (no client cap paywalls)
• Australian servers, AEST support
• GST-ready billing
• 14-day free trial

If you're a PT or run a fitness business in Australia — I'd love your feedback. Link in comments.

### LinkedIn 2 — Competitor positioning
```
I spent a week researching every major PT client management platform available in Australia.

The results were surprising:

• PT Distinction ($49-199 AUD/mo) — no mobile app. In 2026.
• Exercise.com — starts at $199 AUD/mo, takes weeks to set up
• TrueCoach — decent product, US servers, $49-99 AUD/mo
• Trainerize — charges extra for custom branding, steep scaling fees

Not one of them was built with the Australian PT market in mind.

We built FitMunch to fill that gap. Australian PTs get:
✓ Unlimited clients from $59/mo
✓ Proper AUD pricing, no conversion fees
✓ 14-day free trial, cancel anytime

If you're a personal trainer or know one — this is worth 5 minutes.

### LinkedIn 3 — Social proof angle (use once you have 1+ customer)
```
We just got our first paying customer for FitMunch.

She's a personal trainer in Melbourne managing 12 clients. She switched from TrueCoach.

Her first message after signing up:
"The loading speed alone is already better. Finally something that doesn't feel like it was built for an American gym chain."

That's exactly what we're building.

FitMunch — PT client management for Australian trainers.
$59/mo. Unlimited clients. 14-day free trial.

## Cold Email

**Subject:** Quick question about your client management (AU PT software)

Hi [name],

I'll keep this short.

I noticed you're a personal trainer based in [city]. I'm building a client management platform specifically for Australian PTs called FitMunch — and I'd love to get your honest take on it.

Why reach out to you specifically? We're targeting trainers who are either:
a) Frustrated with US-based tools (TrueCoach, Trainerize) being slow during Australian hours
b) Still managing clients manually via spreadsheets/WhatsApp

FitMunch gives you client programs, check-ins, progress tracking, and billing — all in one place, built on Australian servers, priced in AUD ($59/mo, unlimited clients).

14-day free trial, no credit card needed.
