## Facebook Group Post (use in 3-5 AU PT groups)

> **Honest question for PTs — how are you tracking client nutrition right now?**
>
> Been talking to a lot of trainers lately and most are still doing WhatsApp screenshots, spreadsheets or just "vibes checking" on meal plans.
>
> I've been building something specifically for Australian PTs — client meal + workout tracking in one place, you get a dashboard for all clients, they get a simple portal. No app download needed.
>
> It's in early access right now — **14-day free trial, no card.** Looking for 10 trainers who want to test it and give me honest feedback.
>
> If you're interested or curious: fitmunch.com.au
>
> Happy to answer any questions here. 🙏

## Instagram DM (to PTs with active client content)

> Hey [Name] — love your content, the post about [specific recent post] was solid.
>
> Quick one: I built a client tracking tool specifically for Australian PTs — meal logs, workout history, progress charts, all in one dashboard. About half the price of TrueCoach and works out of the box.
>
> Running a free trial right now with no credit card. Would you want to give it a go with a couple of clients? Happy to set it up for you personally.
>
> Zero obligation — just looking for honest feedback from real trainers.

## LinkedIn Message

> Hi [Name],
>
> I noticed you're a personal trainer in [City] — wanted to reach out directly.
>
> I've built a client management platform for Australian PTs — nutrition tracking, workout logging, and a dashboard so you can see all your clients in one place. It's cheaper than TrueCoach ($99 AUD vs ~$140 AUD) and actually has the meal tracking that PT Minder doesn't.
>
> Currently offering a 14-day free trial with no card required. Would you be open to trying it with a couple of clients?
>
> Either way — good luck with the business.

## Conversion Goal Per Channel

| Channel | Reach/day | Expected trial rate | Expected paid conversion |
|---------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| FB Groups (3 posts) | 200-500 PTs | 5-10% = 10-50 trials | 20-30% = 2-15 paid |
| Instagram DMs (20/day) | 20 | 10-20% = 2-4 trials | 25% = 1-2 paid |
| LinkedIn (10/day) | 10 | 15-20% = 2 trials | 30% = 1 paid |

**Week 1 realistic outcome:** 5-15 trials → 2-5 paying PTs → $118-$495 MRR  
**Month 1 realistic outcome:** 30-60 trials → 10-20 paying PTs → $590-$1,980 MRR  
**Month 3 with consistency:** 80-100 paying PTs → $4,720-$9,900 MRR
